# Easy-effects minecraft plugin
## Brief introduction
This was one of my first plugins I created, as I found the current systems of minecraft buffs/debuff application bulky, so I created this plugin to "simplify" the commands.

The basic idea of this plugin was that instead of typing a long command, you could type, for example /speed *level* *playername* to apply the effect. 

While this wasn't the must useful project, it was my first plugin and was extremely enjoyable to mess around with the project, so it definitely one of my favourites from that era.
